### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I think the labs did prepare me to complete the assignment. However, I wish we spent more time going over topics at the beginning and working towards the end because I felt a bit unprepared initially coming in.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have definitely added a side bar feature. I was having a lot of trouble adding this because I noticed that my liked and watched buttons would only add movies to their respective arrays rather than remove it. Therefore, I would've spent more time considering the components I put each feature in and how they could better interact with each other.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think my project demo went well in terms of the functionality of the project. However, I decided to do my css at the end, so I wish I had more time to make it more visually appealing like my peers did.

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

Shout out to Tosin! She helped me a lot with figuring out how to implement my side bar and although it did not work in the end, it was extremely helpful when learning about props and components.
